# Car Counting using YOLO and SORT

This project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for object tracking to count vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes) that cross a specified line in a video feed.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate vehicle counting in a video stream using deep learning-based object detection and tracking techniques. It employs YOLO for real-time object detection and SORT for multi-object tracking. The counting line is defined within the video frame, and each vehicle crossing this line is counted and displayed in real-time.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: YOLO is used to detect vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, and motorbikes) in the video stream.
- **Object Tracking**: SORT tracks the detected vehicles across frames to maintain their identities.
- **Counting Mechanism**: Vehicles crossing a user-defined line are counted and displayed on the screen.
- **Visual Feedback**: Graphics are overlayed on the video stream to enhance visualization of tracked objects and counting results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- cvzone (for overlay graphics)
- Ultralytics YOLO (pre-trained model and library)
- SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have the correct versions of Python and the required libraries installed.

## Usage

1. Place your video file (`cars.mp4`) in the `Videos` directory.
2. Ensure the YOLO pre-trained weights (`yolov8n.pt`) are in the `Yolo-Weights` directory.
3. Adjust paths in the code if necessary, particularly for images and configuration files.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python car_counting.py
   ```

5. Press 'q' to exit the application.
